# Delegates-and-Events
A very simple program utiliziing delegates and events. By implementing delegates and events it allows the program to be more robust when it comes across information the user wants the program to act on. The program is more efficent as well using delegates and events in the code as opposed to full function calls or incrementers to keep track of the instances called or declared. This program's goal has a simple function of taking in a selection of integers inputted by the user and indexing each individual value as either a zero, an even, or a odd. After doing so by using the correnct delegate and event calls the program then prints out a final count of occurrences in each respective category.
